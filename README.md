# smart-time
## Thesis
Time is the measurement of our attention. Our attention is the vector by which we move. Time is money. Time is capital. Tracking time should be as important as tracking your health metrics. 
### What is this?
I am using low-code tools to hack an AI smart time tracking and scheduling tool. My goal is to prove that there is no strict division between technical and non-technical. You can learn and build anything if your attention is directed in that way.
